I am a student in the [MSc Machine Learning program](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/machine-learning-msc) at University College London(UCL). Before starting at UCL I recieved a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics(with a focus on Statistics) from the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx) where I worked with [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/) on active search and deep representation learning.

My research interests span across the field of AI, including but not limited to Bayesian Deep Learning, NLP, and AI ethics.

I'm also a co-founder of a political engagement and data analysis startup, [Pulse](https://pulseboard.co/), which recently became an [MIT Sandbox](https://sandbox.mit.edu/) team.

I'm currently writing my thesis with [Professor John Shawe-Taylor](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/), with additional supervision from [María Pérez-Ortiz](http://mariaperezortiz.com/) and [Omar Rivasplata](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ybc8CeEAAAAJ&hl=en) on self-certified learning for probabilistic neural networks.

After graduating from UCL I plan to work as a ML Engineer at Microsoft AI in Boston.
