I am a student in the [MSc Machine Learning program](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/machine-learning-msc) at University College London. Before starting at UCL I recieved a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics(with a focus on Statistics) from the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx) where I worked with [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/) on active search and deep representation learning.

My research interests span across the field of AI, including but not limited to Bayesian Deep Learning, decision-making under uncertainty, and the Meta-Learning paradigm.

I'm also a co-founder of a political engagement and data analysis startup, [Pulse](https://pulseboard.co/), which recently became an [MIT Sandbox](https://sandbox.mit.edu/) team.
