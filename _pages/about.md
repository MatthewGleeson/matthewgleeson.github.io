I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/msai/) working on inference at-scale. Before that, I was a Machine Learning Engineer on Microsoft's [MAIDAP](https://www.microsoftnewengland.com/maidap/) team. Before that, I was a student in the [MSc Machine Learning program](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/machine-learning-msc) at University College London(UCL).

Before starting at UCL I recieved double degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics(with a focus on Statistics) from the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx) where I worked with [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/) on active search and deep representation learning.

My research interests span across the field of AI, including Bayesian Deep Learning, NLP, RL, and AI ethics.

At UCL I wrote my thesis with [Professor John Shawe-Taylor](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Shawe-Taylor/), with additional supervision from [María Pérez-Ortiz](http://mariaperezortiz.com/) and [Omar Rivasplata](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~omarr/) on self-certified learning for probabilistic neural networks.
